•	Analyzed large data-sets, provided by Cisco, to understand machine behaviors and establish patterns to predict machine failures in the network
•	Visualized telemetry data to classify machine failures and study how traffic through crashed machines is rerouted
•	Built a statistical model which used features including rolling averages and gradients to differentiate between machine failures and passive fluctuations in the network.
•	Successfully achieved accurate predictions within 12 seconds after the crash first started
•	Tools used: Python packages including numpy and pandas for data handling; matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
